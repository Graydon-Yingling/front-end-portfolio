12/30/23: As I learn HTML, I will be sharing my improving projects for all to see.

01/30/24: I've been learning HTML and CSS for about a month now. I learn and practice when I can because I'm still in school, but I have made a lot of progress. Most recently I have learned how to use flexbox and media queries to make responsive and better laid-out web pages. Soon I will be learning the CSS Grid and Bootstrap. I post all of my course projects in my portfolio which is linked here on Github. I intend to update my portfolio as I learn.
